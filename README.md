### Welcome to the Inksden Project

Inksden is a project/library created by [**Aldrin Mathew**](https://github.com/AldrinMathew) to help developers prototype web applications and webpages faster and more efficient in React.

It is written in ***Typescript***, so you get to catch most of the errors during development.

## Documentation

The documentation for Inksden is work in progress, especially because the library itself is in heavy development. Be patient, and thanks for checking out Inksden so early.
